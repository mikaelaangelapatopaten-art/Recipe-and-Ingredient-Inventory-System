## 🧩 Overview
**Ready-Up Recipes** is an all-in-one system that helps you stay organized in the kitchen — whether you’re a student chef, home cook, or small restaurant owner.  
It lets you store your favorite recipes, track your ingredient inventory, and “ready-up” for your next meal with confidence and zero stress.

This system simplifies how you manage both your *recipes* and *ingredients*.  
No more guessing what’s in your pantry — it tracks stock levels, helps you plan meals, and even suggests what you can cook based on what you already have.  

It’s designed to reduce food waste, improve meal planning, and bring order to your culinary creativity.
